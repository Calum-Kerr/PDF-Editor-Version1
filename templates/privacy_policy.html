            <p>
                Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
            </p>

                We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:

        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where we need to perform the service you have requested (e.g., processing your PDF files).</li>
                <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
                <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We never sell your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">4. Data Security</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
                All PDF files uploaded to our service are automatically deleted from our servers within 24 hours after processing, unless you specifically request extended storage.
