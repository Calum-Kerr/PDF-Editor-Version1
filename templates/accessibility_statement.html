                RevisePDF is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We aim to comply with all applicable standards, including WCAG 2.1 (Level AA).

        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">1. Measures Taken</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                We have taken the following measures to ensure accessibility:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementation of semantic HTML structure</li>
                <li>Proper labelling and descriptions for interactive elements</li>
                <li>Sufficient colour contrast throughout the site</li>
                <li>Clear and consistent navigation</li>
                <li>Keyboard accessibility for all functionality</li>
                <li>Text resizing without loss of functionality</li>
                <li>Alternative text for all meaningful images</li>
                <li>ARIA landmarks and roles where appropriate</li>
                <li>Regular testing with assistive technologies</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">2. Compatibility with Assistive Technologies</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                RevisePDF is designed to be compatible with the following assistive technologies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screen readers (including JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack)</li>
                <li>Speech recognition software</li>
                <li>Screen magnification tools</li>
                <li>Alternative input devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We test our website regularly with various assistive technologies to ensure compatibility and to identify areas for improvement.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">3. Compliance Status</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.
            </p>
            <p>
                RevisePDF is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">4. Known Limitations</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                Despite our best efforts to ensure accessibility, there may be some limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some PDF documents within the site may not be fully accessible. We are working to provide accessible versions of all documents.</li>
                <li>Some third-party content that appears on our website may not be fully accessible.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                We are continuously working to address these issues and improve the accessibility of our website.

        <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-3">7. Formal Complaints</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                While we strive to maintain an accessible website, if you encounter problems that cannot be resolved, you can file a formal complaint.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the UK, website accessibility for public sector bodies is enforced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) or the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI).
            </p>
            <p>
                Although RevisePDF is a private company, we are committed to the principles of digital accessibility and take all reasonable complaints seriously.
            </p>
